# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my assignment solutions for the Deep Reinforcement Learning course (430.729_003) offered by Seoul National University (Spring 2020).

The algorithms for the assignments are implemented using TensorFlow in Python.

### Assignment1 (TensorFlow):
Environment Setup, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### Assignment2 (TensorFlow):
Imitation Learning

### Assignment3 (TensorFlow):
Deep Q Learning
 
### Assignment4 (TensorFlow):
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

### Assignment5 (TensorFlow):
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
